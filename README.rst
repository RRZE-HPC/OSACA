OSACA
=====

Open Source Architecture Code Analyzer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This tool allows automatic instruction fetching of assembly code,
auto-generating of testcases for assembly instructions creating latency
and throughput benchmarks on a specific instruction form and throughput
analysis and throughput prediction for a innermost loop kernel.

Getting started
===============

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
On most systems with python pip and setuputils installed, just run:

.. code:: bash

    pip install --user osaca

for the latest release.

To build OSACA from source, clone this repository using ``git clone https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/OSACA`` and run in the root directory:

.. code:: bash

   python ./setup.py install

After installation, OSACA can be started with the command ``osaca`` in the CLI.

Dependencies:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Additional requirements are:

-  `Python3 <https://www.python.org/>`_
-  `Graphviz <https://www.graphviz.org/>`_ for dependency graph creation (minimal dependency is `libgraphviz-dev` on Ubuntu)
-  `Kerncraft <https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/kerncraft>`_ for marker insertion
-   `ibench <https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/ibench>`_ or `asmbench <https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/asmbench/>`_ for throughput/latency measurements

Design
======
A schematic design of OSACA's workflow is shown below:

Usage
=====

The usage of OSACA can be listed as:

.. code:: bash

    osaca [-h] [-V] [--arch ARCH] [--fixed] [--db-check] 
    	  [--import MICROBENCH] [--insert-marker] 
	  [--export-graph GRAPHNAME] FILEPATH

-h, --help
  prints out the help message.
-V, --version
  shows the programâ€™s version number.
--arch ARCH
  needs to be replaced with the wished architecture abbreviation.
  Possible options are ``SNB``, ``IVB``, ``HSW``, ``BDW``, ``SKX`` and ``CSX`` for the latest Intel micro architectures starting from Intel Sandy Bridge and ``ZEN1`` for AMD Zen (17h family) architecture.
  Furthermore, ``TX2`` for Marvell`s ARM-based ThunderX2 architecture is available.
--fixed
  Run the throughput analysis with fixed probabilities for all suitable ports per instruction.
  Otherwise, OSACA will print out the optimal port utilization for the kernel.
--db-check
  Run a sanity check on the by "--arch" specified database.
  The output depends on the verbosity level.
  Keep in mind you have to provide a (dummy) filename in anyway.
--import MICROBENCH
  Import a given microbenchmark output file into the corresponding architecture instruction database.
  Define the type of microbenchmark either as "ibench" or "asmbench".
--insert-marker
  OSACA calls the Kerncraft module for the interactively insertion of `IACA <https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-architecture-code-analyzer>`_ marker in suggested assembly blocks.
--export-graph EXPORT_PATH
  Output path for .dot file export. If "." is given, the file will be stored as "./osaca_dg.dot".
  After the file was created, you can convert it to a PDF file using dot: `dot -Tpdf osaca_dg.dot -o osaca_dependency_graph.pdf`

The **FILEPATH** describes the filepath to the file to work with and is always necessary

______________________

Hereinafter OSACA's scope of function will be described.

Throughput & Latency analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As main functionality of OSACA this process starts by default. It is always necessary to specify the core architecture by the flag ``--arch ARCH``, where ``ARCH`` can stand for ``SNB``, ``IVB``, ``HSW``, ``BDW``, ``SKX``, ``CSX``, ``ZEN`` or ``TX2``.

For extracting the right kernel, one has to mark it beforehand.
Currently, only the detechtion of markers in the assembly code and therefore the analysis of assemly files is supported by OSACA.

**Assembly code**

Marking a kernel means to insert the byte markers in the assembly file in before and after the loop.
For this, the start marker has to be inserted right in front of the loop label and the end marker directly after the jump instruction.
For the convience of the user, in x86 assembly IACA byte markers are used.

**x86 Byte Markers**

.. code-block:: gas

    movl    $111,%ebx       #IACA/OSACA START MARKER
    .byte   100,103,144     #IACA/OSACA START MARKER
    Loop:
      # ...
    movl    $222,%ebx       #IACA/OSACA END MARKER
    .byte   100,103,144     #IACA/OSACA END MARKER

**AArch64 Byte Markers**

.. code-block:: asm

    mov x1, #111            // OSACA START
    .byte 213,3,32,31       // OSACA START
      \\ ...
    mov x1, #222            // OSACA END
    .byte 213,3,32,31       // OSACA END

.. Include new measurements into the data file
.. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. Running OSACA with the flag ``-i`` or ``--include-ibench`` and a specified micro architecture ``ARCH``, it takes the values given in an ibench output file and checks them for reasonability. If a value is not in the data file already, it will be added, otherwise OSACA prints out a warning message and keeps the old value in the data file. If a value does not pass the validation, a warning message is shown, however, OSACA will keep working with the new value. The handling of ibench is shortly described in the example section below.

Insert IACA markers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Using the ``--insert-marker`` flags for a given file, OSACA calls the implemented Kerncraft module for identifying and marking the inner-loop block in *manual mode*. More information about how this is done can be found in the `Kerncraft repository <https://github.com/RRZE-HPC/kerncraft>`_.
Note that this currrently only works for x86 loop kernels

Example
=======
For clarifying the functionality of OSACA a sample kernel is analyzed for an Intel CSX core hereafter:

.. code-block:: c

    double a[N], double b[N];
    double s;
    
    // loop
    for(int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
        a[i] = s * b[i];
        
The code shows a simple scalar multiplication of a vector ``b`` and a floating-point number ``s``.
The result is written in vector ``a``.
After including the OSACA byte marker into the assembly, one can start the analysis typing 

.. code:: bash

    osaca --arch CSX PATH/TO/FILE

in the command line.

The output is:

.. code-block::
